# Weather_Clock

  This is an Arduino Based Weather Clock using NeoPixels. Displays the weather (temperature and precipitation), NWS alerts, and sends discord messages.

  Weather display:
    * Temperature: Using color coding on the clock: red -> warmer, gold -> cold, blue -> stay the same. (range can be changed)
    * Percipitation: Using flashing of the Temp LEDS on the clock: flashing -> high precipitation, solid -> low precipitation. (range can be changed)
